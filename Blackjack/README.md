# Blackjack

A more advanced project for the Udemy Python Boot Camp, covering classes, custom exceptions, and system functions.

`bj_classes.py` - Defines a series of classes, including the players, the cards, and the deck.

`bj_errors.py` - Defines the custom exception `BetTooLarge`, covering when the player tries to bet more than they have.

`blackjack.py` - The main game "engine" file. Uses clear screen and timing functions to update after each "draw", for a bit of pizzazz. Should completely conform to standard Blackjack rules.
