# KenKen Hint Generator

A personal project. Takes in a series of parameters regarding the math-based boxes in the KenKen puzzle and outputs the possible solutions to fill the cells within.

`kenken.py` - The program file.

`KenKen Hint Generator.ipynb` - The Jupyter notebook that contains all my rough ideas, pseudocode, code testing, etc. to show my general though processes.
